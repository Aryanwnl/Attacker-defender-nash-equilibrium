## Overview

This repository contains my original mathematical paper proving the existence of **Nash equilibrium** in attacker–defender cybersecurity games.

The work models cybersecurity as a strategic game between:
- **Attackers** choosing attack vectors  
- **Defenders** choosing detection and mitigation strategies  

Using **Kakutani** and **Brouwer fixed-point theorems**, the paper proves that under realistic conditions, there always exists at least one stable pair of strategies where neither side can improve unilaterally.

## Why this matters

Modern cybersecurity is adversarial.  
Attackers adapt. Defenders adapt. Each side makes strategic decisions under uncertainty.

This paper provides the **formal mathematical foundation** behind:
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- Cyber risk modeling
- Security investment decisions
- Red-team vs Blue-team strategy
- Adversarial AI and malware defense

By proving that Nash equilibria exist, we show that optimal defensive strategies are mathematically guaranteed to exist — making game-theoretic security models valid.

## What this project demonstrates

This work shows my ability to combine:
- Advanced mathematics
- Game theory
- Cybersecurity
- Strategic decision modeling
- Formal proof writing

Rather than relying on simulations or heuristics, this paper establishes **theoretical correctness** for cybersecurity strategy models.
