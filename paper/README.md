## Summary

The paper models cybersecurity as a two-player strategic game between an attacker and a defender.

Each player selects strategies to maximize their own payoff:
- Attackers seek to maximize breach success
- Defenders seek to minimize risk and loss

Using convex strategy spaces and continuous payoff functions, the paper proves — via Kakutani and Brouwer fixed-point theorems — that at least one Nash equilibrium exists.

This guarantees that:
- Optimal attack strategies exist  
- Optimal defense strategies exist  
- Stable cybersecurity configurations are mathematically valid
